[**AWS-TGW-Lab.yaml**](https://github.com/zscaler-bd-sa/AWS/blob/main/Zscaler/AWS-TGW-Lab/AWS-TGW-Lab.yaml) | Cloudformation template to create AWS TGW lab

This cloudformation template automatically creates a slightly modified/simplified version of what is described in the blog referenced in the template above, but can be tested using the steps in the blog.

## Running the cloudformation template

This cloudformation template can be used to create a [stack](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacks.html), either via the Console, AWS CLI, or the Cloudformation Designer. You will need to input your source IP to restrict SSH to the Bastion host, and your Keypair to use. This should then create the entire environment, including the three EC2 instances, and be ready for you to test with.

## How I tested the deployed environment

For testing, I followed the "Testing the deployment" section in the [AWS Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/creating-a-single-internet-exit-point-from-multiple-vpcs-using-aws-transit-gateway/) (referenced in the original sample AWS template link above) but connected to the Bastion host and then the App instances using [SSH agent forwarding](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/securely-connect-to-linux-instances-running-in-a-private-amazon-vpc/) to validate that they could fetch content from the Internet but could not connect to the other App/VPC. I did need to omit the blackhole route for 192.168.0.0/16 mentioned in the blog in order to route back to the Bastion host.
